### Notes
For all the challenges, I am using Windows subsystem for linux (wsl). A program that lets you use the linux operating system on your windows machine. So some of these solutions - especialy those involving the terminal - may only work on a linux os.

### Explanation
The name of the challenge hints to using the inspector. By visiting `view-source:http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924/`, we find the first part of the flag at the bottom of the html file. The website talks about htm√∏, css and javascript, and in the head of the html file, there are links to the css and javascript file. In these files, you can find the rest of the flag.
