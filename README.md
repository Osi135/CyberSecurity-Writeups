# CyberSecurity-Writeups

This project contains all my CyberSecurity writeups (documentation of my process through hacking challenges.)
## [Ctf](/ctf/)
Ctf's are competitive hacking chalenges, where the players tryes to find a flag (a string ph characters) in a digital system, using different tools and knowledge, depending on the challenge. To win a ctf, you copy and pasted the flag in to a field for submition.

### [PicoCTF](/ctf/PicoCTF/)
PicoCTF Is a grate place for practicing your skills in bite sized tasks of different difficulty. 
## [Wargames](/wargames)
Wargames are hacking challengs somewhat similar to CTFs where you have to find an sobit a flag hidden in a digital system, but with no timelimit and often made more for learning, than competing.

### [Hack The Box](/wargames/Hack%20The%20Box)
Hack the Box is a popular and well-known platform for learning hacking and cybersecurite. It's focused on a capture the flag type approach where you're hacking and attacking boxes, popping them, getting privilege escalation, getting root, and moving on. They have different levels of difficulty and there's gamification with the scoreboard.
