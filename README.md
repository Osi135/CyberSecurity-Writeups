# Cyber Security Writeups
This project contains all my cybersecurity writeups (documentation of my process through hacking challenges.)
## [Ctf](/ctf/)
Ctf's are competitive hacking chalenges, where the players tryes to find a flag (a string ph characters) in a digital system, using different tools and knowledge, depending on the challenge. To win a ctf, you copy and pasted the flag in to a field for submition.

### [PicoCTF](/ctf/PicoCTF/overview.md)
PicoCTF Is a grate place for practicing your skills in bite sized tasks of different difficulty. 
## [Wargames](/wargames)
Wargames are hacking challengs somewhat similar to CTFs where you have to find an sobit a flag hidden in a digital system, but with no timelimit and often made more for learning, than competing.

### [Hack The Box](/wargames/Hack%20The%20Box/overview.md)
Hack the Box is one of the most popular and well-known platform for learning hacking and cybersecurity. It's focused on a capture the flag type approach where you're hacking and attacking boxes, popping them, getting privilege escalation, getting root, and moving on. They have different levels of difficulty and there's gamification with the scoreboard.
You can find my HTB profile here: [Osi135](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/1388003) (You have to be logged in to a HTB profile of your own, to view my profile)

### [Over The Wire](/wargames/Over%20The%20Wire/overview.md)
Over the wire is a website with hacking challenges. It has 16 different challenges. Each challenge has a few dozen levels where each level contains the password to procede to the next level. Each level and each challenge is more difficult than the previous. It is therefor great for learning incrementally. 

## Notes
### Fair play
I want anyone who finds this document to use it to learn. But you wont learn if you are given the answers. So, for all the challenges that you can find permanently on the web and solve yourself, I have not provided the exact answer (The flag), because I don't want to ruin the fun for anyone. Th exeption is the timed one-of challenges i have participaded in. There I might add the exact answers.
